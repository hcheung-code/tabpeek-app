# Tabpeek PRD

## Objective
Improve tab navigation within Chrome by providing a side panel that displays all tab groups. Users can quickly identify, preview, and navigate to the desired tab—even in large groups with duplicate icons or similar content—by hovering over a tab group in the side panel to reveal a dropdown of its tabs. The side panel also allows users to move tabs between groups, making tab management more efficient.

## Problem
The problem I am looking to solve is the difficulty of navigating through multiple tabs in Chrome when they are organized into tab groups. When users have a large number of tabs in a group—especially if the tabs are from the same website or have identical icons—it can be extremely challenging to quickly identify and navigate to the right tab. This results in wasted time, frustration, and inefficient workflows.

### User Pain Points:
- When tab groups have many tabs, it's hard to visually differentiate between them.
- Multiple tabs with identical website icons or content make it even more difficult to find the desired tab.
- The current Chrome interface does not provide enough information to quickly identify tabs in a group, leading to cumbersome navigation.

### Background Context:
- Chrome's native tab group feature allows users to organize tabs, but it lacks a clear way to differentiate between individual tabs, particularly when dealing with multiple tabs from the same tab group.
- Users working with research, development, or projects often juggle many tabs, and current navigation tools are not efficient for quick access.

## Key Observations, Data & Insights

### Surveys/Usage Data:
- Data from Google Chrome's user base shows a growing trend in the use of tab groups to manage multiple tabs. However, surveys indicate that users with 10+ tabs in a group find it increasingly difficult to navigate efficiently.
- In a survey of power users, 75% reported that managing large tab groups with similar or identical icons slows them down and detracts from their productivity.

## Core Features

### 1. **Side Panel for Tab Groups and Tabs with Hover-to-Preview**
- **What it does**: Displays a persistent side panel listing all tab groups. Users can preview tab titles by hovering over each group, which reveals a dropdown of all tabs in that group. Users can see tab titles, favicons, and group names, and can switch to or move tabs between groups directly from the panel.
- **Why it's important**: This allows users to quickly identify and manage tabs, eliminating the need to click through multiple tabs or expand tab groups in the tab strip. This is especially helpful in large groups with many similar tabs.
- **How it works**: The user opens or pins the side panel. The panel shows all tab groups. Hovering over a group reveals a dropdown of its tabs, with clear titles and favicons. Users can click to switch tabs or drag-and-drop/move tabs between groups. The panel updates in real time as tabs or groups change.

### 2. **Seamless Integration with Chrome's Native Tab Groups**
- **What it does**: Enhances Chrome's built-in tab groups without replacing or conflicting with them. Users can still use Chrome's native tab grouping feature but with added visual enhancements and management from the side panel.
- **Why it's important**: By augmenting Chrome's native feature, Tabpeek avoids the complexity of introducing a new system for users to adopt. It enhances an existing, widely-used feature, which minimizes user adoption friction.
- **How it works**: Tabpeek works in the background, monitoring Chrome's native tab groups. The extension activates when the side panel is opened and displays the necessary previews and details.

### 3. **Simple, Intuitive Interface**
- **What it does**: Provides a clean, minimal side panel interface that's easy to use and doesn't require complicated configurations.
- **Why it's important**: Users need a fast, intuitive way to navigate their tabs without the complexity of a full tab management system.
- **How it works**: Tabpeek's UI is non-intrusive. It only appears in the side panel and doesn't clutter the screen. The interaction is seamless, requiring no additional setup or management.
